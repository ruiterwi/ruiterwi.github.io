    <h1>Some stuff about me</h1>
    <h2>My life</h2>
    
    <p>I am a junior at MSU and I am from Holland, MI. I like to hike, listen to music, hang out with friends, and watch basketball.</p>
    
    <h2>The best fish to eat</h2>

    <p>I think that fish is the best food. You can make different kinds of dishes from around the world with different fish. To rank these fish, I like to think how good it is raw, cooked, and how it looks.</p>
